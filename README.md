# SETT-LAB-PROJECTS
This repository presents experimental investigations on fluid-surface interactions conducted under the guidance of Prof. Soumyadip Sett at IIT Gandhinagar. Using high-speed imaging, droplet impact behavior was studied on bare and CuO-coated superhydrophobic copper meshes. Condensation experiments were performed on copper plates and foams with varied wettability—superhydrophilic, hydrophobic, and superhydrophobic—revealing enhanced performance on superhydrophobic surfaces. The study demonstrates how surface treatments and wettability influence droplet dynamics and condensation efficiency
